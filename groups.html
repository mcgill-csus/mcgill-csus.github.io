        <p>McGill Robotics is an engineering design team of undergraduate students who build robots for international competitions. The team’s mission is to foster interest in robotics through competition, to cultivate a relationship with the surrounding Montreal community, and much closer to home, to create a core community at McGill via the “Team Before Machine” philosophy. </p><p>
We prioritize team bonding and growth along with engineering accomplishment, with the belief that it takes a solid team to build a winning robot. This year we have a core team of 154 students from 14 departments including a large group of new students! We have expanded to include not only the AUV(Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) team participating in the RoboSub Competition, but also the Mars Rover Team which will be building a tele-operated Rover for a Mars-like environment as part of the University Rover Challenge. The team is also composed of a Business Team which manages the substantial organizational effort, the branding and the outreach program. </p> <p>
The first part of the year is devoted to equipping the team with relevant skills needed for robotics and getting to know each other in a professional setting. Senior members work closely with the new students to transfer their knowledge and prepare them to be our future leaders.
Every start of the school year, we recruit motivated and hardworking students from all years and all faculties who wish to be part of an always growing community and share their passion for engineering, design and robotics. </p> <p>
