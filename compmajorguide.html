<h2 id="choosing-the-right-program">Choosing the Right Program</h2>

<p>This text is an adapted version of the similar material provided by the School of Computer Science on the previous version of the cs.mcgill.ca website (2012 and earlier).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca">School of Computer Science</a> offers a variety of programs both within the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science.</p>

<h3 id="bachelor-of-science-bsc-faculty-of-science">Bachelor of Science, B.Sc. (Faculty of Science)</h3>

<p>Most of our students choose a B.Sc. degree program. The B.Sc. degree is suitable for you if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you are coming from a high school program outside of Quebec and you have enjoyed and succeeded in both mathematics and science; or</li>
<li>you are coming from any CEGEP program from within Quebec with the necessary science prerequisites.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>There are four main programs available in the B.Sc. program:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-computer-science">Major in computer science</a> (also available with a <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-computer-science-computer-games">computer games option</a>)</li>

</ul>

<br>

<p>Other programs include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-computer-science-and-biology">Major in computer science and biology</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-liberal-program-core-science-component-computer-science">Liberal Program - Core Science Component Computer Science </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-liberal-program-core-science-component-software-engineering">Liberal Program - Core Science Component Software Engineering </a></li>

</ul>

<br>

<p>A major in computer science or software engineering provides a good general background in foundational and applied computer science. If focusing on software, you'll be exposed to more courses pertaining to the principled development of software. It contains ten core required courses, and three additional sets of courses from which to choose complementary courses; you can supplement your major with any 21 COMP credits at the 300-level or above.</p>

<p>If you are pursuing an honours major, you'll have fifteen required courses, two groups from which to choose complementary courses, and an additional 21 COMP credits to choose from at the 300-level or above. An Honours program gives you a deeper and more comprehensive education in computer science (and is particularly encouraged if you seek to attend graduate school) and requires a thesis.</p>

<p>If you choose to study computer science within the B.Sc. program, you'll have much more flexibility when it comes to choosing your courses. You can easily supplement your studies with a minor in other faculties.</p>

<p>If you decide on a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering, then you should choose "Faculty of Science" on your application form and choose the physical, earth, math and computer sciences group. The only exception is that the Computer Science and Biology Joint Major is in the Biological, Biomedical and Life Sciences group.</p>

<h3 id="bachelor-of-arts-ba-faculty-of-arts">Bachelor of Arts, B.A. (Faculty of Arts)</h3>

<p>Some of the students associated with the School of Computer Science choose to complete a B.A. degree; in fact, for international students, the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/student-accounts/tuition-charges/fallwinter-term-tuition-and-fees/undergraduate-fees">cost of studying within the Faculty of Arts</a> is approximately half that of studying in the Faculty of Science. It's possible to get quite a strong training in computer science within the B.A. degree program by taking both the computer science major concentration along with the supplementary minor in computer science. In terms of computer science content, this is almost the same at the B.Sc. major in computer science.</p>

<p>There are two main programs available in the B.A. program:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/arts/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-arts-ba-major-concentration-computer-science">Major in computer science</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/arts/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-arts-ba-major-concentration-software-engineering">Major in software engineering</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/arts/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-arts-ba-supplementary-minor-concentration-computer-science">Supplementary minor in computer science</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>The B.A. degree is suitable for you if your background does not include very much science, but you do have a good background in Mathematics and you have an interest and aptitude for logical reasoning.</p>

<h3 id="bachelor-of-arts-and-science-ba-bsc">Bachelor of Arts and Science, B.A.&amp; B.Sc.</h3>

<p>The combined B.A. &amp; Sc. degree, jointly offered by the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Arts is also an option available to our students. In the B.A. &amp; Sc degree you can combine a 36-credit major concentration in computer science or software engineering with a major concentration or two minor concentrations from arts. For example, you could combine your computer science studies with areas such economics, anthropology, philosophy, linguistics, or geography.</p>

<p>Another option is the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/cogsci/cognitive-science-program">Interfaculty or Honours program in Cognitive Science</a>. This is currently the only major and honours programs in cognitive science available at McGill (there is cognitive science minor in the B.Sc. program). You can choose a principle of area concentration, namely computer science.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-computer-science-and-computer-engineering">What is the difference between Computer Science and Computer Engineering?</h3>

<p>The School of Computer Science (in the Faculty of Science) offers degrees in Computer Science, whereas the Faculty of Engineering offers a degree in Computer Engineering.</p>

<p>A computer science degree is more suitable for students more focused on the foundations of computer science and the development of software, or students who would like to combine their studies with mathematics or physics or with a wide variety of minors in science, management, marketing or arts.</p>

<p>A Computer Engineering degree is suitable for students who want core engineering courses and prefer to specialize more in computer hardware than in computer software. The engineering degree programs have significantly less flexibility for combined studies and fewer courses relating to software.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-computer-science-and-software-engineering">What is the difference between Computer Science and Software Engineering?</h3>

<p>The main difference is that the Software Engineering program contains a larger set of required courses concerning the principled design and development of software. It is also important to note that the computer science major also puts more emphasis on mathematics courses.</p>

<p>If you are entering McGill from a high school, you may not have to decide which you prefer right away. You can start with the introductory courses that are common to both programs and then decide which you prefer.</p>

<p>If you are entering McGill from CEGEP, then you will be asked to specify a major when you apply. However, there is still quite a bit of flexibility and you will have some time to decide which you prefer. If you are accepted to McGill in the Faculty of Science you can change your major from Computer Science to Software Engineering (or vice versa) when you actually register at McGill, and you can even change it after you have taken some introductory courses.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-bsc-and-bse-degrees-in-software-engineering">What is the difference between a B.Sc. and B.S.E. degrees in Software Engineering?</h3>

<p>If you have decided that you would like to pursue a degree in software engineering, you still have to decide if you would prefer the B.Sc. in software engineering, offered through the School of Computer Science in the Faculty of Science, or the B.S.E. in software engineering offered through the Faculty of Engineering. What is the difference?</p>

<p>Both the B.Sc. and B.S.E programs in Software Engineering share a common core of software engineering courses, and you will be with the same students in many of these core courses. The B.Sc. degree is structured so that you have quite a bit of flexibility to take more courses about software or general computer science. You also have the option to follow 7 or 8 elective courses which gives you the opportunity to take further higher-level software courses or to pursue a minor program in another field.</p>

<p>For students coming from CEGEP, the B.Sc. degree fits into 90 credits and can be completed in three years.</p>

<p>The B.S.E degree is structured so that in addition to courses specific to software engineering, you must also take many engineering-specific courses that are common to the engineering degrees, in addition to hardware courses.Students in the B.S.E. program must take required courses such as Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering, Circuit Analysis, and Fundamentals of Signals and Systems. For students coming from CEGEP, the B.S.E. degree is 112-114 credits, to be completed in at least 3 1/2 years. Students graduating from this program are eligible for registration as professional engineers as the program has been accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.</p>

<p>Make sure you decide which program you would prefer when you apply to the university because switching between Faculties can be difficult.</p>

<h2 id="internships">Internships</h2>

<p> Many students in computer science benefit from an internship during the summer. Not only are these typically well-paid in our field, they give you valuable work experience. Work experience can  translate into an easier time on programming assignments within your curriculum and help you secure a full-time position after graduation. A large majority of the students who complete an internship the summer before their final year will receive a full-time job offer to return post-graduation.</p>

<p> You can find internship opportunities through your own professional network or by attending the <a href="http://www.mcgilltechfair.com">TechFair</a> in both the Fall and Winter semesters. You can also visit <a href="http://caps.mcgill.ca">CaPS</a>. 
</p>

<p> Additional information on the internship program within the Faculty of Science at McGill can be found <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/science/programs/internships">here</a>. The Faculty of Arts has a similar internship program described <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/arts-internships/faculty-arts-internship-office">here</a>.

<h2 id="courseload">Courseload</h2>

<p>Wondering what you should be expecting in terms of course load as a CS student? You can first take a look at the departmental suggested schedules <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/undergrad/streams">here</a>.</p>

<p>Your first year following the computer science curriculum might be daunting; you'll be taking multiple technical courses at the same time but remember that if you enjoy your program of study, it will be a rewarding experience. The time management skills required to study for exams while completing assignments for multiple courses is something you will rarely encounter outside of the School of Computer Science and a skill that will be valuable for the full duration of your university studies.</p>

<h3 id="courseload-faq">FAQ</h3>

<blockquote><p>I'm currently registered for COMP 250 (or 251), 206 and 273 in the same semester. Is the workload manageable?</p></blockquote>

<p>COMP 250 (or 251), 206 and 273 is completely manageable. If you are majoring in computer science or software engineering, you should get accustomed to the course load as early as possible because it doesn't get easier. If you take a look at the academic information provided on cs.mcgill.ca, you'll see that in the <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/undergrad/streams">recommended schedule</a>, if you're planning to do your major in three years depending on whether or not you're starting with 202, you will be needing to take quite a few computer science courses at the same time. Although yes, some classes are hard, if you really love what you're studying then it isn't so bad!</p>

<blockquote><p>The McGill website lists COMP ABC as a prerequisite for COMP DEF, but I'd really like to take COMP DEF next semester without having taken COMP ABC. What should I do?</p></blockquote>

<p>It is generally not recommend taking a course without the necessary prerequisites. Typically, prerequisites are in place for a reason and you should complete courses in order to ensure success. Talking to the professor teaching COMP DEF is a great first step.  Other than that, before deciding to "skip" a prerequisite, it is recommended that the student look up the most recent final for the course and attempt it. It is also recommended the student take a look at the course syllabus and lecture material for self-study. If the student does not feel satisfied with their performance on the sample final exam or does not think that they could obtain higher than a B, then it is not recommended they skip the prerequisite. That being said, the professor teaching COMP DEF can decide to unregister all students without the necessary prerequisite. In certain cases, the professor may request the student fill out a form in order to take the course without its prerequisite.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-these-profs">Who are these profs?</h2>

<p>The School of Computer Science has a highly reputable faculty; you can find more information about each professor and his or her area of research <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/people/faculty">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="profs-faq">FAQ</h3>

<blockquote><p>Prof X is teaching COMP ABC next semester and I'm worried. Is there anything I can do?</p></blockquote>

<p>First of all, for all academic concerns, you should contact your VP Academic; they'll know how to best approach the situation. Second, if you're concerned about a particular prof, you may want to speak to the professor directly about your concerns.</p>

<blockquote><p>How do I find a COMP 400/COMP 396 project and corresponding supervisor?</p></blockquote>

<p>You can look up profs by their area of interest and look at any of their current projects. If those seem interesting, you should contact the professor about participating in their research. If you already have a project idea in mind but think it might need to be revised a bit or narrowed down, see if it matches up with any professor's area of research and set up a time to discuss the idea with them. There is a list of completed COMP 396 and 400 projects available <a href="">here</a> with student name, supervisor name, thesis title and corresponding presentation if applicable.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<h1 id="course-directory">Course Directory</h1>

<p>There is a sample syllabus provided for each course; this may not be from the most recent offering of the course and please be wary of changing contents depending on professor.</p>

<p>You'll find that in computer science, most courses consist of a midterm exam, three to five assignments, and a final exam. Some will include a project component in addition to or instead of a final exam. Most courses are focused on learning the concepts and problem-solving techniques rather than memorization but there are constantly new terms with which you will need to familiarize yourself and new programming languages to which you will be exposed.</p>

A great strategy is to code as much as you can (try to do the exercises from the book) to prepare for the assignments. As mentioned before, the assignments are not trivial, they are long and challenging, especially for these who do not have programming experience, it's a good idea to start early (also you get to read about bugs other people had and test if your code has them too).

Vybihal will generally use the board quite a bit in addition to slides so make sure you get a seat with a good view of the board. 206 is one of the most disorganized courses I've taken mainly due to the fact that so many random topics are thrown in. It teaches you how to use tools that are quite useful and how to learn new programming languages quickly but it is done in a very haphazard way. The best way to do well in this course (beyond experimenting a lot with each of the programming languages reviewed) is to keep tidy notes and take the time to memorize important terms. The best way to do well on the final exam is to do sample finals from previous years. </td>

<td align="left"> COMP 273 is a great class! It covers a lot of hardware principles that aren't covered in most required CS courses and gives just enough depth so that you understand how processors work (but not too much to make you doubt whether you're in computer science or computer engineering). There's a few assignments, a midterm, a project and a final exam. The project involves making a CPU that can handle multiple-digit number multiplication. It gets tricky but it's a really fulfilling experience when it finally works! MIPS assembler language is also taught in the course - it takes a little while to wrap your mind around but once you practice enough (as with any other programming language) you really get the hang of it. Some would argue that there's lots of memorization but I think it involves more of an understanding of how things work rather than the part names. For instance, you may feel you have to memorize all the names of the CPU components, but in fact, if you understand the process that each command must go through as it is processed by the processor, you'll be reminded that you have an ALU somewhere in there, a program counter, and some registers to save intermediate steps if necessary. </td>

Many of the concepts taught in the course are very interesting but if you have a hard time with the material, don't worry: you might not ever have to touch functional programming ever again. The class consisted of 5 assignments with one being to implement a mini programming language. There was a midterm and a final exam; the midterm is known to have a notoriously low average. When I took the course, it was taught in SML which had very little documentation. Thankfully it's been revised since and although the language may change according to which prof is teaching the course, typically it's now done in more commonly used programming languages with better documentation. </td>

You can read more about how COMP 303 has changed and is viewed from the prof and student perspective <a href="../comp_303_feedback.html">here</a>. That being said, the material covered in 303 will definitely come back to haunt you in the industry and could help you stand out in technical interviews. You'll walk out of 303 with a first taste of what real programming consists of. If you're already a reasonably experienced programmer, the design patterns and coding conventions will fill gaps in your knowledge and give names to thing that you already knew. If not, it's a pretty solid idea of what to get used to when programming slightly larger systems than in the introductory classes. The problems are less algorithmic and preformed for you, forcing you to learn how to organize your software so that it doesn't run away from you as it grows. </td>

<td align="left"> <b> Class Size: </b>
Looking at my classlist, there were 14 registered but about half of that actually came to the lectures. I'm sure the fact that it was the first class of the day for many people (9:30 am on a Monday).
<br>
<b> Class structure: </b>
One lecture a week for 45 minutes and a 30 minute lab session with the TA. The slides have a lot of information on a topic (sometimes a topic is spread across a few slide sets) but with only 45 minutes, only the general idea is explained. A lot of code examples exist to help you work through each assignment and at the end of the lecture slides are "Teacher Notes" which provide extra information, context, and further readings.
The lab assignments are simple tasks to help you get started with the actual marked assignments. They are given to you at the beginning of the week and lab sessions are really just a dedicated timeslot to talk to the TA if you are having issues or if you have further questions. Only about 2 or 3 people would come to these labs, but the TA was great at giving extra information on the subject and it was a good place to play around with the code presented in the lecture slides.
<br>
<b> Workload: </b>
4-5 Assignments. My term had 4 assignments and I believe there are usually 4 assignments. If I recall correctly, there were initially supposed to be 5 assignments, but due to time constraints and to keep the stress of the class to a minimum (with the understanding that it was in fact a 1 credit class), Vibyhal would occasional ask us how the assignments were going and adjust accordingly. The nature of the assignments allowed for flexible adjustment and instead of removing a topic, less was required for each task and more than one topic might have been covered in an assignment.
I cannot recall the actual amount of time an average assignment would take, but I believe we were given around 2 weeks per assignment (give or take a week). Each assignment is clear in what is expected to be delivered, but standard to most Comp Sci courses, it takes a lot of time to just to get the ball rolling and not too long once you've figured out the proper approach. The lectures provide a general overview of how we should tackle to assignment with helpful code snippets. The tricky part is deciphering the necessary parts to get the job done.
<br>
<b> Subject Material: </b>
The course teaches you practical examples of low-level programming. The material is geared towards graphics programming by focusing on how to read data from the graphics card, manipulating specific pixels, and creating increasingly complex images. Early assignments are in x86, an assembly language, compiled on a virtual machine to simulate a 286 and 386 dos computer. These assignments had us creating libraries that we could use for later assignments. Later assignments are in C and use OpenGL to create animated images. Other topics discussed are how to run assembler commands in C, shader programming (CG), and simple graphics algorithms. 
<br>
<b> General Impression: </b>
From what I recall, everyone I asked wished it was a full 3 credit class. For the later assignments, where you're actually drawing pixels or creating OpenGL images, there is a lot of room for creativity. However, the amount of time one has to dedicate to a 1 credit class is always taken over by other (usually core) classes and these assignments are usually rushed in a day's worth of work. 
There is way more information on each slide than what is mentioned in class and each set concludes with further readings. The assignments were really easy as long as you put in time (the TA is very reasonable even if you're not getting the result you were hoping for). Once again, it just didn't feel like there was enough time to go through all the readings.
<br>
<b> What I got out of it: </b>
I really liked the class, but I'm heavily interested in graphics. I also grew up using a 286 machine, so it was interesting seeing what it took to produce the graphics that made the games of my youth. Also, the pixel-drawing algorithms seemed to mimic exactly the way MSPaint produces lines and fills shapes, so it felt like we were creating a real drawing program. Having assignments that made us build libraries we could use outside of class (even if we wouldn't in a practical sense) seemed more 'real-world' applicable than many other CS courses, so I thought that was cool. I would have liked to understand the material more deeply than I gave myself time for, but it felt like a great introduction to the study of graphics. </td>

<td align="left"> COMP 310 is separated into two major components: the lecture material and the assignments. The assignments/coding component of the course can be quite difficult but very rewarding.  It helps students really nail down the knowledge of C that they gained in 206, while giving a less abstract look at how operating-system-level problems are handled. The lecture material involves a bit of memorization but is still mostly concept-based. You won't end up knowing about any specific operating system in great depth by the end, but you'll know how a number of (sometimes admittedly legacy) systems handle common problems. There is no coding on the midterm or final. </td>

<td align="left"> 361 in many ways is a great complement to 303 because it lets you tackle even larger software projects, which can be one of the trickiest skills to master.  Managing code in a team context is also a vital ability that is addressed here.  The guidance of the professor is always available and should be taken advantage of. Do not wait until the last minute to do the project and consider dreaming small: it's a full-year course for a reason. One might note that the course mainly focuses on object-oriented design so it's recommended you stick with object-oriented concepts in implementing your game. It can be easy to stop going to class regularly especially when many of them are canceled during the second semester, but keep going otherwise you'll fall behind with the material. You will do best in the course if you know all of your UML diagrams backwards and forwards; go through Jorg's examples and practice, practice, practice. </td>

Although I took 251, it was 462 that solidified my understanding of dynamic programming and Markov chains.  It had taken everything that I learned in computer science up until that point and applied it to problems that I had seen in biology. There is a little bit of programming in it, but it's mostly a pen-and-paper algorithms class.  Where it does involve programming, it is a puzzle-solving class. Blanchette is very good at lecturing, and engages the class well.  The class size was roughly 30 students (including those in 561, which is the same course but it includes a final project), and consisted of a mix of grad students and undergrads from different backgrounds, some had no background in biology. If you love computer science and like to see it applied, you will love this course.  The biology that is covered is very basic and is explained in the first two lectures.  This course doesn't need you to understand much more biology than "DNA is transcribed to RNA which codes for proteins". </td>

<td align="left"> COMP 525 is a fantastic class which basically brings together practical software development and theory in an unexpected (at least for me!) way! We continued discussing automata which was first introduced in COMP 330. One of the large focuses of the class was modelling applications/systems as a type of automata which we can then check! It's really neat because in this class you actually learn how to prove that (parts of) your system work according to a formal specification. It has some really interesting math concepts, primarily based on logic, however it has a lot of neat and unexpected links to other branches of math such as topology. There was a final project for the class where we had to research a topic related to the class and present it. This was an awesome opportunity to extend the class into a direction which you found interesting, and the end result was a ton of projects covering a huge breadth of subjects, ranging from category theory to automatically finding flaws in crypto protocols! 

I'd definitely recommend it if you enjoyed 330 and are interested in seeing how logic and automata can be used to make formal statements about your program. One thing to keep in mind is that this is particularly important for "mission critical" systems. This was initially a challenge for me as I tend to focus more on web applications where human lives aren't generally affected and I had a hard time understanding how this formal approach could be used in that scenario. However I promise there is still a lot of value in taking this class especially once you recognize that, while you may not be able to validate an entire web application, you can use this to check the crucial components of your application!

<td align="left"> COMP 529 will pick up where 303 left off and take a look at software at a higher level. You'll learn about the numerous types of architectures and each of their pros and cons. There's a good deal of critical analysis and lots of technical writing. There are some terms that require memorization but the best way to succeed in 529 is to understand the relationships between different architectures and which organizational problems each can solve. Anything that is unclear during lecture (which is rare) can be clarified during Vybihal's office hours.

<td align="left"> 553 this year was kind of all over the place. It gives a nice background over various topics in game theory and gives you a taste of what work has been done so far on the topic. There are fantastic notes for the course as well as good video resources(Tim Roughgarden Stanford, Constantinos Daskalakis MIT) and he follows courses taught at other schools almost directly. You'll definitely want a strong math background when taking it (it's cross listed under Math 553 and having a background in analysis helped) as well as being comfortable with everything you learned in 360/362 is important (a lot of linear programming and reductions). The assignments were brutal (average on the 1st assignment worth 15% of our grade was ~20-30%) but I wouldn't be surprised if the course changed drastically over the next year. Overall it was an okay course, but I think that it will continue to improve. </td>

<td align="left"> Depends on the instructor. Especially heavy in math, not for the weak of heart. Very interesting real-life applications, but it's also a very pointy and precise subject, only recently discovered. Very hard, leads directly to at least Master's level, but the potential for real-life applications is higher than most in maths or computer science, given you can follow up in your master's. If you're not afraid to find the instructor's thesis as a second result when searching the terms seen in class, go for it. </td>
